I DO NOT OWN THE CODE. VECTOR - Suomen Verkkopeliyhdistys ry does.
Personal and demonstrative use allowed.
The ColorPicker component is derivative work from @bamzc 's color picker that can be found at https://github.com/Bamzc/vue3-color-gradient-picker.

The software was commisioned by VECTOR as a FREE educational university project that was done in group with 4 other people.
The software was designed to be used with Node-RED's FlowFuse/FlowForge.
